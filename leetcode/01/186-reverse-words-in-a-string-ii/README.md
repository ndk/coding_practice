### 186. Reverse Words in a String II
**Medium**

Given an input string, reverse the string word by word.

##### Example:
```
Input:  "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

##### Constraints:
* `1 <= s.length <= 10^4`
* `s` contains English letters (upper-case and lower-case), digits, and spaces `' '`.
* There is **at least one word** in s.

##### Follow up:
* Could you solve it in-place with O(1) extra space?

##### Note:
* A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.
* The input string does not contain leading or trailing spaces.
* The words are always separated by a single space.

##### Follow up:
* Could you do it in-place without allocating extra space?
